create a timer feature that we can switch between

use the format of the stopwatch to create the timer
the apps component will be responsible to switch between the two functionality


so how does a timer work?

you are supposed to set a time
and then everytick, the logic decrement the time

but the first step we need to is to create a boiler plate
1 - display for the time
    1a - section for hour
    1b - section for minutes
    1c - section for seconds 
2 - start button
3 - stop button


Here will be the main functionality:
    1. Set time
    2. start time
    3. Stop time
    4. reset time
